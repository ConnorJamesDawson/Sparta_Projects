# PairProgramming - BubbleSort & Collections Lab

## Bubble Sort

For the bubble sort we looked at the test we had to complete and implemented the BubbleSort Method in the Program class.

In that method we look at how long the array wee are sorting is, loop through as many ints there are but the last one, as Bubble sorting is the way of sorting an array by looking at an element and the one after, if the first element is bigger than the one after swap elements.

The sort should end with the array being sorted with lowest first.

### Array Merge

In this method we made a new result array, added the first array to the result array, concatonated the second array to the result array and then sorted it.
