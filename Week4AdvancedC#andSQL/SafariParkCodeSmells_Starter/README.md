# Code Smells

## Refactoring

Refactoring is changing the code body of a method without changing the output of the method

### When should you refactor?

When there is an objective to refactor the code into

When the project is source controlled already so you have a version to fall back on

When all tests run and pass

## Code Smells

Code that is recognisably bad but still works, e.g brute forcing

Inappropriate Names, Dead Code, Duplicate code, Long Methods, Feature Envy, repeted if else/switch chains
