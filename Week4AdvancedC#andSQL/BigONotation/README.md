# Algorithmic Complexity - Big O Notation

##  What makes a good algorithm

Correct - returns the expected output

Efficient - Doesn't take more time than necessary

How do we meaure time efficiently? Big o notation

O(1) - one operation
O(n) - multiple operations
O(n2) - Quadratic, two nested loops
O(n3) - Cubic three nested loops

This can get out of hand quite quickly, for example for the wedding plan example, having only 7 possible places had 10000+ examples.

Algorithms that have O(n!) are inpractable/ unreasonable

Unreasonable orders

O(n3)
O(n!)
O(2pown)
O(npown)
