C# Notes-

Trade offs between languages

Saftey for control

.NET compiles code/c# into the common intermediate language

then to common runtime language, makes it into cross platform by compiling code into machine code

To the OS/Hardware

.NET Framework is for Windows only. Or at least until 2014 NOT CROSSPLATFORM 

.NET Core is the multiplatform one for UWP and ASP.NET.

Xamarin is for IOS OS X and Android

Underneath all programs, it has one standard library

.NET, Just that, is for the united platform.

#ASP.NET

Active Server Page - c# on the web - used to create APIs, web apps

Framework - an environment to develop in

Create REST APIs
