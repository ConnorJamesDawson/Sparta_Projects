#Strings, Arrays, DateTime, and Enums

##What is StringBuilder and why is it used?

Stringbuilder allows a string to be mutable, to be changed without having to create a new object 

##What is String Interpolation?

An interpolated string is a string literal that might contain interpolation expressions. 
When an interpolated string is resolved to a result string, items with interpolation expressions are replaced by the string representations of the expression results.

a $"" marks a string for interpolation

##What is string parsing?

A TryParse also has an out value that is the result of the Parse method

##What is the difference between a multidimensional array and a jagged array?  

A multidiensional array is more uniform as each array has the same length

A jagged array has different lengths for each of the second arrays
