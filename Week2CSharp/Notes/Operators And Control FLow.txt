#Give an example of a ternary operator  

variable_name = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if false;

int c = (a%b==0) ? c=a : c=b;

#What does the modulus operator do?  

% returns the remainder value from dividing the lhs from the rhs so 4 % 2 = 0, 4 % 3 = 1

#What is the result of dividing integers 10 by 4  

Integer division means no decimals so answer is 2

#How would you calculate the number of weeks and days in 34 days?  

int weeks = 34 / 7;
int days = 34 % 7;

#What is the difference between a postfix and a prefix increment operator?  

postfix increment c++; This operation happens last 
prefix increment ++c;

The Prefix operators increment or decrement the variable prior to dereferencing the object, while the Postfix operators increment or decrement the variable after referencing it.

#What is the difference between a unary and binary operator?  

A binary operator has two operands. For example the addition operator acts on the operands a and b.

a+b

A uniary only has one such as ! in boolean statements or the - in numbers

#Which types of operator have the lowest priority?  

logic expressions have the lowest priority, such as & | and ,

#What is the difference between an if-else block and a switch-case block?  Give an example of when you would use each.  

If else blocks are used to compare two conditions, true or false, if true execute code, if false don't

A switch case is used to compare multiple conditions, or 'cases' in the same block for better user readability

What are the 4 types of loop (just name them) 
for , foreach, while, do while

#What is the difference between a for- loop and a foreach- loop?  Give an example of when you would use each.

For is an iterator using a counter, foreach loop looks at each individal object of a collection whilst cycling through it

For loops are good for controlling the iteration through an array, such as when you want to get every second object in an array

Foreach are good for iterating through an array whilst looking at each indiviual object in a collection

#What is the difference between a while- loop and a do while- loop?  Give an example of when you would use each.

A do while executes the code once before the while loop takes effect.
