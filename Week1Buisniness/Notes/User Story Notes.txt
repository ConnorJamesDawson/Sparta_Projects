1. As a beginner parachuter, I want to know what lessons are available so that I can improve my skills

2. As someone who wants to buy their own parachute I want to see if there are any upcoming sales on the website
3. As the client I want the website to be laid out to be attractive and non cluttered so that I don't have to read irrelevent information
4. As a potential customer, who lives far away I want to know what the weather is like so that I dont have a wasted journey
5. As a fan of the parachuting school i want to be able to buy memorabilia and tshirts so that I can show my support

Only need quantity and card details for transaction
