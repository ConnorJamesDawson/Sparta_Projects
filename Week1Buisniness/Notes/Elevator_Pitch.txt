Focus on personal details, technicals are covered in Profile

I am Connor Dawson, avid Gamer and Manchester United Fan 

Although Uni focused on C++ and C#, I challenged myself 

In my final project for my Masters Degree I created a self learning AI that could play Doom Through Python through Image recognition 

Through my time at my previous work, was Assisstant manager, was given control of the workplace when boss not available

Have experience with customer interaction with complaint handling as well as staff interaction

Through my 6 years experience and good work ethic I was chosen to be taken on for further training to take on my own pub,
by a regional manager of the brewery

Through this oppertunity I desire to develop myself to become a core part of the development team with a look to take on a lead role.
